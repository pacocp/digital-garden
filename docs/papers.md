# Scientific Papers

## How to read scientific papers

1. **Read the title** and make an opinion of what's in the paper (e.g., the area, the task)
2. **Read the abstract well** and form a hypothesis of
    1. What's new in the paper?
    2. Do you have a clear **overview** about what the paper is all about?
3. **Look at the images** and extract a set of "questions" about what is not clear about their method from the images. Now your job is to answer these questions by reading the paper.
4. **Read the introduction carefully** to get a high-level understanding of the paper.
5. **Read the method** aiming to answer your "questions" about the paper. Focus on understanding only the things relevant for the story (i.e., to understand the contribution).
6. **Read the experiments** to convince you that the show results are caused by their claim. Be aware that the experiments highlighted are the best scenarios and are fully hyper-parameter tuned.
7. **Make sure you answered all your questions.** Did the authors convince you that their story has the effect that they claim?
