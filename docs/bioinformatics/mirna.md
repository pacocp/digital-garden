# miRNA

## Basics

- They are formed by 20 nucleotides.
- They do not encode a protein.
- 20.000 discovered genes inn humans and in multicelular organims they are also found.
- Some are special for each specie.
- Also they are some whgich are also tissue specific or general sometimes.
- They are postrascriptomicm which means they they regulate the expression of RNA to the protein.
- Usually they are supressors of gene expression.
- What they make is supressing proteing generation or a fewer quantity of the protein is produced.
- They bind perfectly to the message.
- One miRNA can bind to many RNAs. So it can regulate the expression of a huge
  number of genes. And one gene can be regulated by many miRNA.
- Few genes are not regulated by miRNA.
