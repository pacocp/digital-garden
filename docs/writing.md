# Writing

## Scientific Writing

- What not to do:
  - Readers can't struggle with your sentences.
  - Is it the sentence redeable?
  - Is it written to inform or to obscure?
- Not convert verbs into nouns.
- Complex ideas do not require complex language.
- Scientific writing should be easy and even enjoyable to read!
- Don't have a lot of distance between the verb and the noun of the sentence.
- Avoid unnecesary jargon and acronyms.

### Principles of effective writing

1. Cut unnecesary words and phrases; learn to part with your words.
2. Use the active voice (subject + verb + object).
3. Write with verbs.

### Cutting clutter

- Don't use two words when not necessary.
- Cut unnecesary words:
  - Be vigilant and ruthless.
  - Try the sentence with those extra words and see how it's better - conveys
    the same idea with more power.

- Common clutter:
  1. Dead weight words and phrases:
    - As it is well known...
    - As it has been shown...
    - It can be regarded that...
    - IIt should be emphasized that...
  2. Empty words and phrases.
  3. Long words and phrases that could be short.
  4. Unnecesary jargons and acronyms.
  5. Repetitive words or phrases.
  6. Adverbs:
    - very, really, quite, basically

- Try to convert negative to positives.
- Try to eliminate the there are / there is.
- Omit needless preprositions.

### The active voice

- Advantages of the active voice:
  1. Emphasizes author responsability.
  2. Improves readibility
  3. Reduces ambiguity.

- The passive voice may be appropiate in the methods Section, where what was
  done is more important than who did it.
- Avoiding personal pronous doesn't make something more objective.

### Grammar tips
  
- The word data is plural.
- Affect is the verb "to influence".
- Effect is the noun form of to influence.
- Compare to = to point out similarities between different things.
- Compare with ** = to point out differenced between similar things. 
- that vs which:
  - "That" is the restrictive (defining) pronoun.
  - "Which" is the non-restrictive (non-defining) pronoun.
  - If we use which, that part can be removed. If we use that, it is essential.
  - Do not use "they" or "their" when the subject is singular. To avoid gender
    choice, turn to a plural
