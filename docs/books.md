# 2021

### Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything

*Joshua Foer*

I was interested in this book on the premise of understanding how to improve my memory. It is true that nowadays we relay less and less on our it, thanks to technology. Can you think about those days when you had to remember all those phone numbers?

Having a memory palace, a place where you place the things you want to remember, gives you a more visual representation on those things you want to maintain in your brain. It is true that this technique works, quite amazingly I would say, given the author experience.

The importance of memory nowadays have been relegated to pass an exam. It is required in the majority of them, but no memorization technique is taught in the classrooms - at least in Spain.

### The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks

*Rebecca Skloot*

It is amazing how we can be using something without knowing the story behind it. The story of Henrietta Lacks might be unique, given all the advances that have been made with her cells. However, this story is not only remarkable for what it implies for science, but because it shows the lack of empathy that sometimes we, as researchers, have for patients. 

I wonder if, instead of a african-american family would it been a caucasian family things would have been different and more respect would have been given.

### Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland 

*Patrick Radden Keefe*

Previously to reading this book I didn't know much about the Northern Ireland conflict. This fascinating book carefully explains it, in a very journalistic way. The story is told based on facts that have been gathered through the years, showing the lights and shadows of it. 

I can relate everything that this book explains with the ETA conflict in Euskadi, Spain. I wasn't born during the most active years of ETA, but having watched and read about it, it is impossible not to compare with the conflict in Northern Ireland.

I totally recommend this book, whether you are interested in the story of Ireland or not.

### Nada es imposible 

*Kilian Jornet*

In this book, Kilians talks about all the experiences that he have had during his life, and how he has accomplish them. In comparison to his other books, this mainly talks about how to achieve the goals set, and relates how he has reached them during his life. It is written in a more personal, humility way.

### Historia visual de la inteligencia 

*José Antonio Marina*

Amazing book about the history of inteligence. It takes you on a travel from the eyes of an alien that is trying to understand humans. It resambles to Sapiens, which is cited in the book, but talking about other topics related to intelligence and sociology. Totally recommended.

### Días Ajenos. Primavera – Verano, un diario de diarios 

*Bob Pop*

An intimate and deep travel with the soul of the author. I cannot really say what this book is about without just saying it is about life. One life, or many lifes. I never thought that reading paragraphs from diaries could provide such an insight on people fealings. I should start writing a diary.

### Death in Venice

*Thomas Mann*

A book that is beautifully written, but that didn't totally resonate with me. I understood the story, the thoughts of the main character, but I just could enjoy the marvelous vocabulary and the prose.

### Ruined by Design: How Designers Destroyed the World, and What We Can Do to Fix It 

*Mike Monteiro*

This book makes a clear statement: We are designers and therefore, we need to protect the final users. While this is completely true, and I totally believe on this claim, I think that the main topic of the book is repeated all over it. I liked the book, and I enjoyed it, but I really think that it could be shorter.

### ¡Eureka!: 50 descubrimientos científicos que cambiaron al mundo 

*Rocío Vidal*

I follow Rocío since quite a while. I really like her work as a scientific communicator, and I bought this book given that. This books suits you if you don't know much about general scientific discoveris. However, mainly well-known discoveries are explained, if you have some scientific background I think that you will not learn much new.

### Pretérito imperfecto: Historias del mundo desde el Año de la Pera hasta ya mismo 

*Nieves Concostrina*

I declare myself a fan of Nieves Concostrina. The way she relate history is awesome, and she has a marvelous sense of humour. This book contains some pills of historic knowledge, and some extravangt events. Totally recommended if you like history, and you are interested in Spanish history, because since the author is Spanish, many of the related events are from the history of Spain.

### It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work 

*Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson*

Last year I read *Rework*, from the same authors, and I found it fascinating. The technology industry has derived in a hustle culture that I do not think is sustainable nor healthy. In this book, the founders of Basecamp tell how they approach the management of their company, with great advices in order to have a calm company. Some of these advices can be implemented in research, and I will try to do it. Someday I would like to work in a company like Basecamp.

### Explaining Humans

#### What Science Can Teach Us about Life, Love and Relationships*
*Camilla Pang*

How humans resamble to human relationships or behaviours is amazing. It is true
that many of our actions can be related to science facts. However, I wasn't
truly engage with this book. I don't know if it is because how it is written,
which is mainly autobiographical or when I read it, but maybe I will re-read
it in the future. 

### Obfuscation

#### A User's Guide for Privacy and Protest 

*Finn Brunton, Helen Nissenbaum*

Nowadays privacy is a hot topic. Companies sell our data, but because we are
using their services for free. It is true that leaving those servicies is an
utopia, but obfuscation gives a path to fight for privacy while using these
services. Really interesting book, and I keed an eye on the tools they describe [trackmenot](http://trackmenot.io/) and [Adnauseam](https://adnauseam.io/).

####  The Story of More: How We Got to Climate Change and Where to Go from Here

*Hope Jahren*

In this amazing book a summary of how we have reached the climate condition that we are suffering nowadays is depicted. It is terrifying to read about how we have increased all the consumption of natural sources, and I think that the pace is not going to slow down. 

In order to stop this, I think that those of us who are lucky to live in wealthy countries need to stop our non-sustanaible way of leaving. We need to live with less, in order to reach an equilibrium. I am a vegetarian, and I try to be as zero waste as possible, but you can always do more. I want to try to do more.

#### North: Finding My Way While Running the Appalachian Trail 

*Scott Jurek,Jenny Jurek*

This book outlines the amazon FKT (Fastest Known Time) of Scott Jurek in the
Appalachian Trail. But, I think it is also focused on that, without truly
amazing people around us, we are not able to accomplish the impossible.
 
#### The Buy Nothing, Get Everything Plan: Discover the Joy of Spending Less, Sharing More, and Living Generously 

*Liesl Clark, Rebecca Rockefeller*

Interesting idea on how to spend less while regaining more relationships.

#### Vernon Subutex, 2 

*Virginie Despentes*

I am really enjoying this saga. It is true that I firstly enjoyed the TV show,
and this is more or less the continuation of the first season, but Virginie
prose is rapid and engaging. 

#### The Infinite Machine: How an Army of Crypto-hackers Is Building the Next Internet with Ethereum

*Camila Russo*

Amazing book about the Ethereum story. It is truly engaging, and the pace of
the writing is wonderful. With this kind of books I feel the urge of starting
my own business, but I still need to find the idea!
